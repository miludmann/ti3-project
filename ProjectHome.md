Goal: ease the learning of the boardgame by playing it on a computer version that takes care of all rules subtleties, and decrease the time of play by automatizing tedious yet necessary tasks (combat rolls and alike).

How: get the main board projected on a big screen while each player manages his "hand" and personnal area on an android device.
The game mechanics should all be totally integrated into the program, with maximum flexibility for potential customization.
